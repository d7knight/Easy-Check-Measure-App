# Easy-Check-Measure-App
I created this app to help out my dad with his small business. It allows you to record window measurements for a potential customer and display these measurements nicely in a table within a pdf document. You can also then email this document to someone with a generated email from this app. Furthermore if you have a google cloud printer handy you can print off the document within the app. Later versions of the also have the ability to interact with a bluetooth LE Disto Laser Measurement devices, to receive measurements or trigger measurements.
